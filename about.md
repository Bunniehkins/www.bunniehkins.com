<img style="float:right;" src="/whoami.png"> I am a freelance anthropomorphic illustrator specialising primarily in digital art. I live in the UK and outside of drawing I spend a majority of my time either in university, gardening or working on craft projects.



My fursona, Bunnieh, is a wererabbit enchantress. Blessed with the marking of the ‘never-ending crescent’ she is able to prolong the effects of the full moon’s gaze. Despite her existence little is known about lapinthropy.

I am looking to expand and adapt as an artist, learning as I go. Feedback and support from fans is hugely important to me and inspires me to keep on creating!
