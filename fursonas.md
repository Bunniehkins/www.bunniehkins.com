  - flavour: Bunnieh is my main fursona and I have had her ever since I first joined the fandom back in 2013 (albeit changing dramatically over the years alongside me). Bunnieh is a lionhead rabbit born with a strain of hybridised lycanrthropy causing transformations on a full moon. Obsessed with the powers and perks of the transformation, she performed a ritual, perminantly scarring herself with the mark of the moon, allowing herself to constantly remain in her transformed state. Bunnieh is loyal and loving to family, yet aggressive when provoked, with a strong urge to protect the people she loves. Despite this no-nonsense attitude however, she is fun and friendly to all those who treat her in the same way.

  - flavour: Vex (or Vexbeast) is my secondary sona, and also my newest, having been officially created in summer 2018. They are a Non-binary (with male pref) creature with sass, attitude and teeth to put many to shame. You may see vex strutting about at many Londonfurs meets, be sure to say hi! He doesnt bite! (always)
