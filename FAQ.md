<h3>WHY A WERERABBIT?</h3>


Bunnieh was redesigned into her current form in late 2017. As my irl confidence and personality was growing and shifting I felt that a rabbit was too meek and mild for me. I wasn't keen however on turning her into a canine, so I decided to go crazy and turn her into a carnivorous beast of a rabbit, flipping the idea of cute and mild on its head, if you will.

<h3>I WOULD LIKE TO COMMISSION YOU BUT I HAVE NO MONEY, WHAT CAN I DO?</h3>


Due to the amount of time I spend on my art I cannot afford to work for free, however there are many alternatives! Keep an eye out on my twitter and art accounts for raffles and giveaways, or better yet, make a donation on KOFI to receive a thank-you doodle~

<h3>DO YOU ATTEND CONS?</h3>


Cons are expensive, and all of my savings for everything I do comes from my commission income, due to this I rarely ever attend cons. I DO however attend almost every Londonfurs meet.

<h3>WHO MADE VEX?</h3>


Vex is made entirely by myself, from scratch.

<h3>DO YOU TAKE FURSUIT COMMISSIONS?</h3>


Unfortunately not, while Vex was made by myself, it was an incredibly stressful process and I had to cut many corners. Although they look solid, the quality is in no way close to something I would take payment for.
